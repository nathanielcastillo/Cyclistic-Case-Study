Data is downloaded from [
](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

Trip data is organized into 1 CSV file per month for a total of 12 CSVs for the year 2023

Data deemed as credible and passes ROCCC method

- [x] Reliable - High Sample Size, over 5 million rows of data    
- [x] Original - Public Dataset provided by Motivate International Inc. 
- [x] Comprehensive - 5 million rows with 13 columns of relevant data
- [x] Current - Data is from 2023
- [x] Cited - Motivate International Inc.

Note that data-privacy issues prevent access from rider's personally identifiable information.
Only individual ride information is collected, information about the riders themselves is not.
Therefore, unable to determine things like if casual riders live within Cyclistic service areas or if they purchased multiple single passes.

Data needs to be cleaned before further analysis due to data quality issues such as null values.

# Process
### Data Cleaning SQL

Data cleaning will be done in MySQL as there are a total of over 5 million rows of data that need to be cleaned  
which is too much for Microsoft Excel to process efficiently

### Creating Master Table to hold data

``` MySQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS 2023_ride_data;
CREATE TABLE 2023_ride_data
(
  ride_id VARCHAR(255),
  rideable_type VARCHAR(255),
  started_at VARCHAR(255),
  ended_at VARCHAR(255),
  start_station_name VARCHAR(255),
  start_station_id VARCHAR(255),
  end_station_name VARCHAR(255),
  end_station_id VARCHAR(255),
  start_lat VARCHAR(255),
  start_lng VARCHAR(255),
  end_lat VARCHAR(255),
  end_lng VARCHAR(255),
  member_casual VARCHAR(255)
)
;
```

### Load data into 2023_ride_data
